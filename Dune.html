            <h3> Brief History </h3>
                <p> Originally published in 1965, what would later be only the first part of a grand and expansive saga 
                    was titled Dune and followed by 5 sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune,
                    Heretics of Dune and, finally, Chapterhouse: Dune. The story of Dune spans a period of five
                    thousand years, weaving a tapestry of multifaceted storytelling under the guise of a great adventure tale.

            <h3>Factions & Planets</h3>

            <p>Behind the Padishah Emperor and House Corrino, the matriarchal order called the Bene Gesserit secretly governed and thus
                controlled the entire known universe. That said, all along, they had been hatching a scheme of their own, a selective 
                breeding program to create a super-being that could bridge space and time, their male counterpart, their Kwisatz Haderach.
                And after millennia of trial and tribulation, they finally found him, ironically, out of time and out of space.</p> 
                <div>        
                    Arrakis, also known as Dune, was the only planet within the imperium whereon were found the geriatric spice, Melange and gigantic cresting, burrowing extraterrestrial life-forms, 
                    with their baleen teeth and cinnamon odor, the sandworms, one of if not the most iconic creatures in science fiction history.
                </div> 
      
                <p>House Atreides, one of the up-and-coming houses in the Landsraad, caught the attention of the jealous emperor, who, in collaboration with the sworn enemy of the Atreides, the 
                    Harkonnen, the fief-holder of Arrakis before the beginning of Dune, devised a plan of exquisite treachery to rid himself of this potential threat. Using the feud between the 
                    two great houses as cover, the scheme saw the transfer of power from the Harkonnen to the Atreides, whose fief now was acheve, an apparent victory to the Duke Leto Atreides. 
                    Ferrying aboard a Spacing Guild Heighliner, the sea-faring house from Caladan uprooted their entire way of life to be relocated to Arrakis but not all was what it seemed. 
                    The emperor’s own military force called the Sardaukar, dressed in Harkonnen livery, pounced on the still-acclimating Atreides. Caught by surprise, they stood no chance against 
                    the coup d’état.</p>

                <p>Head of the house, Duke Leto, was captured and presumably executed, his concubine, the Lady Jessica and his son, Paul Atreides, forced to flee into the desert. Now stranded in 
                    the middle of nowhere, Paul and Jessica must use their Bene Gesserit training to survive. Along the way, they gained the countenance and support of the Fremen, people that 
                    lived on the outer edge of civilization. Paul now swore to exact revenge upon those who had wronged him and who had destroyed his entire life.

                <p>Dune has been adapted for the screen before with mixed results, but Denis Villeneuve's attempt is the most ambitious of them all – and the one with most riding on it. However, if you
                have read the first book it's unlikely to watch this version of Dune and feel like you got a full movie for your money. It’s a great film, but there is this lingering feeling that 
                the next one will be better. </p>

        <div id="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>  
                <p>Dune, and The Dune Chronicles as a whole, deals with fundamental problems that we are all afflicted with, problems that tend to repeat themselves; government and religion riding in the 
                   same cart, masses being manipulated by demagogues. Can't wait to see how the story unravels in the next book. </p>
