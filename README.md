TTA HTML Homework

#tools VS Code
#languages html & css

This week I'm learning html with a little bit of css elements, will cover more css in the following weeks. Learned how to use basic tags to create a web page, tables, forms, add videos and images and to link pages to further information etc. html is great pretty easy but am finding it a little tedious. Did 4 exercises in total - will probably do more later for more practice and add them here.

  -created a "wiki" page on topic of choice-  Dune novels/film (sci-fi geek here..)
    -reverse engineered a travel blog 
      -created a table for a festival workshop schedule - spent hours figuring out how to merge rows :D
        -lastly made a short form -
