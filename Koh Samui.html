                        lesser known haven of <a href= "https://wanderersandwarriors.com/maenam-beach-koh-samui/">Maenam Beach</a>,

                2. Waterfall Hunting"
            </h2>

                <p>
                    A popular island activity, and another of the most popular things to do in Koh Samui is chase waterfalls.<br>

                    </div>
                      
                <br>There are a few other waterfalls scattered around the island but the most popular are <a href="https://wanderersandwarriors.com/namuang-waterfall-koh-samui/">
                    Namuang Waterfalls</a> 1 & 2 for a reason.
                The first being an easy walk down to a beautiful jumping rock, and the second a hike up to a beautiful viewpoint.

            <h2>
                Overlap Stone View Point
            </h2>

            <p>
                There are a few man made viewpoints on the island but this rural one was our favourite!
                <a href="https://wanderersandwarriors.com/overlap-stone-viewpoint-koh-samui/">Overlap Stone</a> is located 
                at the back of an old Thai families home and it’s just a short 
                walk through the jungle to get there.<br>Located just around the corner from Hin Ta & Hin
                 Yai Rocks and <a href="https://wanderersandwarriors.com/lamai-beach-koh-samui/">Lamai Beach</a> 
                 it’s definitely worth adding to your things to do in Koh Samui 
                 list if you’re in the area.
